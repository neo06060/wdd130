        <p>Andalucía is one of the many countries that make part of Spain, in Andalucía we can find a lot of beaches as also a lot of food, this part of Spain is the richest in gastronomy giving all the tourists a lot of food for their taste having lots of variety as also a lot of beauty. As I said before, the beaches from Andalucía are the best, they are loved by tourists thanks to the awesome weather we have all year, the warm weather as also the beaches helps attract tourists as also all the ancient cities we have for them to be visited by tourists.</p>
